		<h1>Sector List implementation with interative examples</h1>
		<p>This page presents supplementary materials to the paper entitled "Representing and processing polygonal maps with Sector Lists". Sector Lists (SLs) is a vector-based representation scheme for polygonal maps, where each point of the plane is mapped to a single scalar value.</p>
		<p>SLs represent polygonal partitions by their boundaries, but rather than structuring these boundaries as circular lists of vertices, all regions are modeled as a set of special objects called <i>sectors</i>. The sectors are organized in lists for efficient plane sweep algorithms using a differential approach.</p>
		<p>SLs contrast with usual polygon-based representations since the latter require more coarse-grained structures such as multipolygons, circulations and holes, as well as must enforce only one value per point.</p>
		<p>The following are four sections for understanding and interacting with the characteristics and properties of the Sector List.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="part-1-sector-list-implementation-in-javascript/index.html">1) Sector List Implementation in JavaScript</a>: data structure with the operations and algorithms described in the paper.</li>
			<li><a href="part-2-sector-list-examples/index.html">2) Sector List Examples</a>: interactive explanations presenting the fundamental operations.</li>
			<li><a href="part-3-sector-list-experiment-1-map-algebra/index.html">3) Sector List Experiment 1 - Map Algebra</a>: exemplifies the flexibility of Sector Lists applying Sector Lists to perform map algebra and GIS multi-criteria analysis.</li>
			<li><a href="part-4-sector-lists-experiment-2-random-polygons/index.html">4) Sector Lists Experiment 2 - Random Polygons</a>: aims at assessing the computational efficiency of Sector List operations as implemented in our prototype, as well as providing some empirical evidence for the complexities of the algorithms.</li>
